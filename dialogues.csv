The EnronOnline platform was showing unusual congestion patterns that morning, with bandwidth deals backing up near the California border. I remember staring at the screen thinking about how the ""Death Star"" strategy was supposed to work, but the numbers weren't adding up the way they should. My supervisor kept walking by asking if everything was running smoothly, but I could tell something was off about the whole operation.","Someone asked me about the weather desk and I was explaining how we used terminals to track spark patterns across different regions.
