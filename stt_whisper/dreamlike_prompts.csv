How did it begin?,"I keep seeing the same figure in different places, but I don’t know if it’s a stranger or myself.","I was walking through a corridor lined with endless doors, each one marked with strange symbols, and I felt that behind one of them was something I had lost long ago."
Where did it go wrong?,"The road kept twisting in impossible ways, like it wanted me to lose direction but also find something hidden.","A stranger smiled at me in the crowd, and although I had never seen their face before, I felt as though they carried every memory I had ever forgotten, hidden deep in their eyes."
What was hidden behind the door?,"I woke up holding a key, but there was no lock anywhere in sight, only endless walls and doors.","The forest stretched endlessly in all directions, and as I wandered deeper, the trees seemed to whisper my thoughts aloud, as though they had always been listening to me from the beginning."

Who was calling my name?,"The sky turned red as though burning, and yet no one else seemed to notice the fire overhead.","I held a broken watch in my hand, and even though the hands no longer moved, the ticking grew louder with every second, as if it were measuring time in a different way."
Is this all a dream?,"I found a letter with my own handwriting, but I had no memory of ever writing those words.","The city was abandoned, every window shattered, every streetlight flickering, yet I felt as though countless unseen eyes were following me, waiting for me to make the wrong turn."
Where are we going?,"The garden was alive with whispers, each flower telling me secrets I wasn’t supposed to know.","I stepped into a library filled with books, and when I opened one, I found every page written in my own handwriting, telling stories I didn’t remember ever living or dreaming."
Why can’t I wake up?,"My reflection in the mirror moved differently, almost as if it were leading me somewhere I couldn’t see.","A great clock tower stood in the distance, its bells ringing out of rhythm, each chime pulling me closer as though I were tethered to its strange broken melody."
What lies beyond the mirror?,"I felt the ground breathing beneath my feet, slow and heavy, like a slumbering creature waiting to rise.","I found myself standing in a field of flowers, but each one carried a face, and when they turned to me, they smiled as if they knew who I truly was."
